  <p>Welcome to my CSS CheatSheet</p>
  <p>// Here I want to Create a Table for CSS Colors cheats</p>
  <h1> CSS Color Cheats</h1>
  <p> There are several different ways to Color your web page. You can use Named Colors, Hexadecimal/ hex Colors, RGB, and HSl. If You wanted
    to add transparency you could add an 'a' value to the end of the RGB and HSl. RGB would be RGBa and HSL would be HSLa.
